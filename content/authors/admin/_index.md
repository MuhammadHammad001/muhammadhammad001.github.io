## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hammad

I'm an incoming **Hardware Security researcher** at [**PSec Lab**](https://github.com/PSecLab), *Penn State University*.

Iâ€™ve contributed to **RISC-V compliance verification** and **embedded systems**, working on tools like **RISCOF**, the **RISC-V Sail model**, and **RISC-V Architectural Tests**.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring **firmware analysis**, **reverse engineering**, and **microarchitectural attacks**.

ðŸ“« *Feel free to reach out for research collaborations!*
