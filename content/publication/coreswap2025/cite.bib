  abstract = {This paper presents the verification methodology and results of the CoreSwap project, where the ARM Cortex-A5 core in ARM Educational Kit SoC was replaced with the open-source RISC-V OpenHW CVA6 core. The project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating a RISC-V core into an existing SoC ecosystem while maintaining functionality and system stability. We detail the comprehensive verification process, including core-level Architecture Compliance Tests (ACTs), manually written system-level tests, FPGA synthesis on a Kintex-7 platform, and running performance benchmarks. The verification strategy highlights the challenges and solutions to validate such a large-scale System on Chip (SoC). This seamless integration and verification of the CoreSwap underscores the potential of RISC-V in proprietary SoC environments.},
